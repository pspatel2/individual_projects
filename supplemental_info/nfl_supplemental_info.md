## Basic Football Terminology:

__Prior to discussing the dataset in further detail, a quick run-down of relevant football terminology will be useful in interpreting the discussion as well as the predictive model.__
*Down: The team in possession of the football has a limited number of downs (four in the NFL) to advance ten yards or more towards their opponent's goal line. If the team is unable to progress the ball ten yards in four downs, the ball is given over to the opponent. Teams also have the option to punt the ball on the 4th down if they do not think they can gain the yards left.
*Yard-line: A football field consists of 100 yards. There is a hash mark at each yard and at every 10 yards there a number painted representing the yard-line. From one end, the yard-line count starts at 0 until midfield which is the 50 yard-line. However, as a team passes the 50 yard-line, the count begins to go from the 50 yard-line down to the 0 yard-line. Figure 1 below depicts this visually
*Pass vs Run play:  A pass play is when the ball is thrown in the air to progress the ball forward versus a run play is when the ball is handed-off (or kept by the quarterback) and is attempted to be moved upfield by running.
*Shotgun: In the shotgun, instead of the quarterback receiving the snap from center at the line of scrimmage, he stands farther behind the line of scrimmage.
